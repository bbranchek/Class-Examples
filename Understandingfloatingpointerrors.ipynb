    "Programming languages like Python use floating-point representation (typically following the IEEE 754 standard) because it offers a balanced trade-off between performance, memory efficiency, and range. Here’s a deeper look at why this approach is favored over \"exact\" representations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Efficiency and Hardware Support\n",
    "Hardware Acceleration: Modern CPUs and GPUs include specialized floating-point units (FPUs) designed to handle floating-point arithmetic at high speeds. This means operations on floats are extremely fast compared to arbitrary-precision arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed-Size Representation: Floating-point numbers are stored in a fixed amount of memory (usually 32-bit for single precision or 64-bit for double precision). This constant memory footprint simplifies memory allocation and contributes to overall computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dynamic Range\n",
    "Wide Range: A floating-point representation can cover a very wide range of values—from extremely small numbers to very large ones. This range is critical for many applications in science and engineering where numbers can vary drastically in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compromise on Precision: Although floating-point numbers don't provide exact precision (most decimal fractions are approximated), this compromise allows them to represent a large dynamic range efficiently. For most applications, the level of precision is sufficient even with these approximations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Trade-offs Between Precision and Performance\n",
    "Exact Representations are Costly: Representing numbers exactly (e.g., as fractions or using arbitrary-precision arithmetic) typically requires more memory and significantly slower arithmetic operations. This increased cost is often unnecessary for many applications that can tolerate tiny precision errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specialized Needs: In cases where exact precision is crucial—like financial calculations—Python offers alternatives such as the decimal.Decimal or fractions.Fraction modules. These options provide exact representations at the cost of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Standardization and Compatibility\n",
    "IEEE 754 Standard: The IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic is widely adopted across programming languages and hardware platforms. This standardization ensures consistency, compatibility, and predictable behavior across different systems and programming environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interoperability: By using a common standard, Python can interoperate more easily with other languages, libraries, and tools that assume or require IEEE 754 behavior."

    "Floating-point arithmetic in Python (and in most programming languages) follows the IEEE 754 standard, which means that numbers are represented in binary with a fixed number of bits. This representation introduces several common pitfalls:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Representation Errors\n",
    "What Happens: Many decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary floating-point numbers. For example, the number 0.1 has no exact binary representation, so it is stored as an approximation."
